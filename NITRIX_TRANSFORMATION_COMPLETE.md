- **Real-time progress tracking** - Live updates during training
- **Template-based automation** - Pre-built pipelines for common use cases
- **Zero manual intervention** - Completely hands-off after intent submission

### **3. Model Dashboard**
- **Deployed model management** - See all your active AI models
- **API endpoints ready** - Every model gets an instant API
- **Usage analytics** - Track performance and API calls
- **Integration examples** - cURL, Python, JavaScript code snippets

### **4. Privacy & Local-First Foundation**
- **Built on existing local storage** - Leverages the privacy-first architecture
- **User data control** - Everything can stay on user's device
- **No cloud lock-in** - Can run completely offline
- **Scalable architecture** - Ready for cloud deployment when needed

## 🚀 **HOW TO RUN NITRIX**

### **Option 1: Switch Main Entry**
Replace content in `src/main.jsx`:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import NitrixApp from './NitrixApp';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NitrixApp />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### **Option 2: Use Nitrix Entry Point**
```bash
# Run the Nitrix version
npm run dev
# Then manually navigate to the Nitrix app
```

## 🎊 **NITRIX VALUE PROPOSITIONS**

### **For Non-Technical Users:**
- "Just describe what you want, get a working AI model"
- "No coding, no configuration, no DevOps"
- "From idea to production API in 5 minutes"

### **For Technical Users:**
